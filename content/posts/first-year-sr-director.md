# Purpose

Today 2022-01-26, I woke up energized, focused, in a mood to get something done. I want to log what I am doing as a Sr. Director to influence culture improve velocity and improve quality. My goal is to make sure that I am on top of my duties and provide results. To solve this problem my approach is to log all my daily things in a "publicy" kind of way, as a reminder that I committed to something and I need to deliver. Additionally I can use this log for my attempt at more self dicipline organized appraoched to stay on top of commitments and succeed. Finally, the feeling of soliving multiple problems, can I measure myself, can I improve, and I show that I improved and can I increase the self-dicipline to speak to my future self that yes, the impact is real and look at the path that was taken. Maybe this goal will help another, that by will, reflection, action, and imagination you can shape reality and reach your real goals.

* Mandated a move for old applications to a new deploy method, speeding up deployment making us more secure and portable
* Disaster Recovery initative is in its final stages for phase 1 to recreate the environment, and verify that the environment is working for what we call a critical path of service for our end customers.

### t = 2022-03-02

* Review of SOX documents
* Offboarding process


### t = 2022-03-18

* A big pause in updates, as the SOX process really consumed everything
* As I reflect on this problem I need to state and record the problem
  * IA hired a firm to shore up the processes of 75+ systems that translates to 1000s of individual combinations of services that must fit a criteia
  * If money flows through the system (fianancial data) or is part of the financial transaction, it provides crucial data - it qualifies for the SOX audit
  * Access
  * Monitoring
  * Backups
  * Deprovisioning
  * Change Control
  * are all in scope.
  * We only had 4 weeks to get 75+ systems done
  * We have to design a control without knowing the system involved and document existing controls, without knowing what the system is or who the owners are.
  * We have to understand what the spirit of SOX is asking for and design on the fly for a discovered system
  * We have to truely qualify the problem to verifiy if financial data is in scope
  * Some vendors do not indicate they backup their data and we will need to somehow backup their data
  * Communication has been lack luster as team members do not understand the scope of the problem
* We are now on track to complete by 3/31
