# Purpose

Today 2022-01-26, I woke up energized, focused, in a mood to get something done. I want to log what I am doing as a Sr. Director to influence culture improve velocity and improve quality. My goal is to make sure that I am on top of my duties and provide results. To solve this problem my approach is to log all my daily things in a "publicy" kind of way, as a reminder that I committed to something and I need to deliver. Additionally I can use this log for my attempt at more self dicipline organized appraoched to stay on top of commitments and succeed. Finally, the feeling of soliving multiple problems, can I measure myself, can I improve, and I show that I improved and can I increase the self-dicipline to speak to my future self that yes, the impact is real and look at the path that was taken. Maybe this goal will help another, that by will, reflection, action, and imagination you can shape reality and reach your real goals.


## Log

###  t < 2022-01-26

* Top level OKR - build multiple environments
* Build a QA Org
* Be innovative and learn the emerging new technologies.

That's the theme that I'm planning for and maybe that could be the formation of SMART Goals.  But what have we done so far:

* Removed a huge security risk in log4j by forcing upgrades, our platform is pretty centralized for how we log, so it was an easy patch.
* Mandated a move for old applications to a new deploy method, speeding up deployment making us more secure and portable
* Disaster Recovery initative is in its final stages for phase 1 to recreate the environment, and verify that the environment is working for what we call a critical path of service for our end customers.
* Sandox Plan is coming along with core working, and a schedule for the next few and a progess information loop. Also pulling in people.
* Q1/Q2 Plan conforming to the process of OKR (ish)
* Gave Focus for Team members
* Held an All hands and lets people know of promotions and our current state
  * Over 20 items covered

* `remembered commitments` - goal promotion in six months for MR
