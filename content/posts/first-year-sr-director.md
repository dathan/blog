# Purpose

Today 2022-01-26, I woke up energized, focused, in a mood to get something done. I want to log what I am doing as a Sr. Director to influence culture improve velocity and improve quality. My goal is to make sure that I am on top of my duties and provide results. To solve this problem my approach is to log all my daily things in a "publicy" kind of way, as a reminder that I committed to something and I need to deliver. Additionally I can use this log for my attempt at more self dicipline organized appraoched to stay on top of commitments and succeed. Finally, the feeling of soliving multiple problems, can I measure myself, can I improve, and I show that I improved and can I increase the self-dicipline to speak to my future self that yes, the impact is real and look at the path that was taken. Maybe this goal will help another, that by will, reflection, action, and imagination you can shape reality and reach your real goals.
