# Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of site reliability engineering (SRE), ensuring the highest levels of uptime is the ultimate goal. Behind the scenes, a symphony of processes and practices come together to achieve this, and at the heart of it all are the rituals that we, as a large SRE team, follow with unwavering dedication. In this blog post, we'll dive deep into the rituals that shape our approach to maintaining uptime, shedding light on how these practices contribute to a resilient system and empowered team.

# The Monday Rituals: Insights and Sharing

Every week, our journey towards uninterrupted uptime begins with a series of orchestrated events that set the tone for the week ahead. The day kicks off with leadership pass downs, where the top-level insights into the system's performance and any potential issues are shared. This serves as the bedrock of our understanding, aligning our team's focus and direction.

Following this, our standup meeting serves as a platform for all team members to be heard. It's a forum where the technical minds come together to exchange thoughts, ideas, and challenges. This collaborative discussion is the first step in bridging the gap between different areas of expertise, an essential factor in our ongoing success.

# The Power of Documentation

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of our rituals lies in the power of documentation. We've harnessed automation to create a comprehensive Confluent Page that summarizes the PagerDuty alerts from the past week. This automated documentation, generated through a cronjob in our Kubernetes environment, ensures that we have an unambiguous record of what transpired. It's not just a log; it's an intelligence-rich artifact that charts our journey towards uptime.

# Observations and Social Communication: The Two Pillars

Our rituals are divided into two main categories: observations and social communication. The "observations" aspect involves delving into the past week's incidents and identifying patterns. This in-depth review provides us with insights into the recurring issues, their root causes, and the efficacy of our remedies. It's a learning process that continuously feeds back into our approach, making us stronger with each iteration.

On the other hand, "social communication" embodies the art of knowledge sharing. We pass down the wisdom acquired from the pages of the past week, discussing not only the challenges but also the ingenious solutions. This practice acts as a crucible for building trust within the team. Trust, in turn, fuels open communication, allowing us to collectively brainstorm solutions and tackle issues head-on.

# Rituals as the Foundation of Trust and Resilience

Our experience over the years has shown us that rituals aren't mere routines; they are the foundation upon which we build trust and resilience. These rituals transform individuals into a cohesive team with a singular focus â€“ keeping the system running without hiccups. The predictability and consistency of these rituals foster a culture of ownership and accountability.

# In Closing

In a world where milliseconds of downtime can lead to significant losses, the rituals we follow serve as the bedrock of our success. They drive the virtuous cycle of learning, adapting, and improving. As a director overseeing a large SRE team, I've witnessed firsthand the power of rituals in shaping a team's dynamics and a system's performance. So, whether you're a veteran in the field or an aspiring SRE enthusiast, remember that the right rituals can propel you towards a future of unprecedented uptime.
