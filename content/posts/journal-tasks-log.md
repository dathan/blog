# Why


My quest is to become better continuously as a human, parent, husband, man, engineer, and person. Better does not mean perfect but know that there is growth and that you never truly stop learning. The current me is good enough, I just want to do things better instead of thinking I am doing them better and that requires tracking and measurement. This is my log of things needed to organize my thoughts and be more self-disciplined.
