## Introduction
Recently, I lost my job due to layoffs. This is the second time in my 29-year career in the tech industry that I've been laid off. I'm passionate about helping people when I can, so I'd like to share my game plan for finding new work. It's worth noting that the last time I was laid off was in 2001-2002, during the big dot-com bubble. I was fortunate enough to avoid the 2008 crisis, and things began to improve afterward.

## Game Plan
* Leverage your network: Reach out to your contacts and see if they have any leads. My friends and former colleagues have been incredibly helpful in my job search.
* Engage with recruiters: While I've had mixed experiences working with headhunters, getting in front of hiring managers is crucial for landing a job.
* Be flexible with positions: I've been fortunate to hold various roles throughout my career in tech, which can sometimes be a double-edged sword. The goal is to get in front of potential employers, so tailor your resume to your target audience without downplaying your accomplishments. You've achieved a lot, and there's no reason to be ashamed of it.

## Expectations
* 50 job applications will result in 10% interviews (5 interviews)
* 5 interviews will yield 1 job offer


## One last note

In times of economic bad times, that is the time to build. When times are good. That is the time to sell. Everything is about selling, so understanding this IMHO will get you far.
