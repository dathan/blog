I use to run a pretty successful blog at mysqldba.blogspot.com, but I started to move in different directions that was doing much more then just mysql. To move into these new areas I basically gave up this focus. As a result, I gave up blogging. Now I am trying to do it again.

This new blog is more of a log, with expdaned tweets that focus on leadership, go-lang, kubernetes, containers, networking, mySQL.
