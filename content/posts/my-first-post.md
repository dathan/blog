In the past, I ran a blog at mysqldba.blogspot.com, but I started to move in different directions away from just the database layer but focused on truely the entire stack. I am doing much more than MySQL, but I still keep up to date and use it in my personal projects. Since I moved into the entire stack, I basically gave up my focus and to an extent my expertise in mySQL. Then I gave up blogging. Now I am trying to do it again.

This new blog is more of a log, with expanded tweets that focus on leadership, go-lang, Kubernetes, containers, networking, MySQL, and more.
