## Problem

An award given should be provable even if that physical representation of the award was lost.


## Solution NFT

Having a way to represent ownership to digital content on the web is a very powerful feature. The decentralized nature of the blockchain or what I like to call very slow peer-to-peer databases gives that implicit trust that a smart contract was minted and cannot change, thus can represent ownership.

## What are NFT

ERC-721, a non fugebal token. ERC-721 has a tokenid and each token is unqiue and each token represents a unique asset. Has on-chain and off chain attributes. on-chain is desired since the attributes are proven by the cryptographic function to pull it on the chain.
