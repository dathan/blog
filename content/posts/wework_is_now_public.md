One of my bucket list goals was to be a part of an IPO. WeWork Inc is now public, and I have achieved my goal.

For about 27 years I have been working in the valley, since the tender age of 19, I have been working in this field. The vast majority of this time has been working for startups, with my goal of moving the needle to do my part to make the collective dream of a public company a reality. Now that I have finally achieved my goal, I don't really feel satisfied. Maybe if the IPO was a life-changing event, I would feel different but I don't and this IPO is not a life-changing event. Then it hit me, what I really wanted and still want. `I want to launch my own company on a public exchange`. Still, this is a great experience, a great company milestone, and it does feel good to achieve a 20+ year goal-yet I think for 20 years I built up in my mind that the IPO is the end of all your hard work. It is not. 

I still desire more. I still desire to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people that has a financial windfall for all those that work on it. My personal struggle continues.
