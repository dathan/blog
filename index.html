My particular use case was reaching devices between multiple colliding networks from the cloud to a physical location someplace around the world. Tailscale is perfect for this use-case, and putting together that project was fun and informative.
Today I read this post by Maisem Ali and Maya Kaczorowski. A fantastic combination of features and abilities that make reaching services in a Kubernetes cluster easy.</div><a href=/blog/posts/tailscale-kubernetes/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10"><div class="db pv4 ph3 ph0-l no-underline dark-gray"><div class="flex flex-column flex-row-ns"><div class="blah w-100"><h1 class="f3 fw1 athelas mt0 lh-title"><a href=/blog/posts/some-thoughts-on-github-hugo/ class="color-inherit dim link">Some Thoughts on Github Hugo</a></h1><div class="f6 f5-l lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">GitHub pages is new for me and I was not aware that the contents of GitHub pages site can be based on branches and path combos. Using the GitHub action and reading the documentation, the action to build is on main. Main is the default branch. The action also executes hugo and publishes the hugo generated site to the root of the gh-pages branch. As a result, a silent step that was needed to automated this blog post.</div><a href=/blog/posts/some-thoughts-on-github-hugo/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10"><div class="db pv4 ph3 ph0-l no-underline dark-gray"><div class="flex flex-column flex-row-ns"><div class="blah w-100"><h1 class="f3 fw1 athelas mt0 lh-title"><a href=/blog/posts/my-first-post/ class="color-inherit dim link">I want to write an informative log ...</a></h1><div class="f6 f5-l lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">I use to run a pretty successful blog at mysqldba.blogspot.com, but I started to move in different directions that was doing much more than just mysql. To move into these new areas I basically gave up this focus. As a result, I gave up blogging. Now I am trying to do it again.
This new blog is more of a log, with expdaned tweets that focus on leadership, go-lang, kubernetes, containers, networking, mySQL and more.</div><a href=/blog/posts/my-first-post/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div></article></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://dathan.github.io/blog/>&copy; Generated Blog by Dathan capturing his random thoughts 2021</a><div></div></div></footer></body></html>
