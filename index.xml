My particular use case was reaching devices between multiple colliding networks from the cloud to a physical location someplace around the world. Tailscale is perfect for this use-case, and putting together that project was fun and informative.
Today I read this post by Maisem Ali and Maya Kaczorowski. A fantastic combination of features and abilities that make reaching services in a Kubernetes cluster easy.</description></item><item><title>Some Thoughts on Github Hugo</title><link>https://dathan.github.io/blog/posts/some-thoughts-on-github-hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 18:11:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dathan.github.io/blog/posts/some-thoughts-on-github-hugo/</guid><description>Unless one uses GitHub pages you may not be aware that the contents of GitHub pages site can happen on branches and path combos.

To move into these new areas I basically gave up this focus. As a result, I gave up blogging. Now I am trying to do it again.
This new blog is more of a log, with expdaned tweets that focus on leadership, go-lang, kubernetes, containers, networking, mySQL and more.</description></item></channel></rss>
