To aid in this ritual, we have an automated Confluent Page, generated from a cronjob that documents all the PagerDuty&rsquo;s pages. The program reads data over PagerDuty&rsquo;s API and writes to Confluence API running as a cronjob in Kubernetes.
These actions described since performed at a regular cadence is a ritual.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/tailscale-kubernetes/ class="link black dim">Tailscale Kubernetes</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Last year I wrote a quick docker image and helm chart to install tailscale into your Kubernetes cluster. My particular use case was reaching devices between multiple colliding networks from the cloud to a physical location someplace around the world. Tailscale is perfect for this use-case, and putting together that project was fun and informative.
Today I read this post by Maisem Ali and Maya Kaczorowski. A fantastic combination of features and abilities that make reaching services in a Kubernetes cluster easy.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/some-thoughts-on-github-hugo/ class="link black dim">Some Thoughts on Github Hugo</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">GitHub pages is new for me and I was not aware that the contents of GitHub pages site can be based on branches and path combos. Using the GitHub action and reading the documentation, the action to build is on main. Main is the default branch. The action also executes hugo and publishes the hugo generated site to the root of the gh-pages branch. As a result, a silent step that was needed to automated this blog post.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/my-first-post/ class="link black dim">I want to write an informative log ...</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I use to run a pretty successful blog at mysqldba.blogspot.com, but I started to move in different directions that was doing much more than just mysql. To move into these new areas I basically gave up this focus. As a result, I gave up blogging. Now I am trying to do it again.
This new blog is more of a log, with expdaned tweets that focus on leadership, go-lang, kubernetes, containers, networking, mySQL and more.</div></div></div></div></section></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://dathan.github.io/blog/>&copy; Generated Blog by Dathan capturing his random thoughts 2021</a><div></div></div></footer></body></html>
